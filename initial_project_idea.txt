My idea for my application is to create an app that utilizes google books api to keep track of the books you would like to read, are currently reading, or have read.  You will be able to look up books and get their information and save them to the db and then add them to lists such as 'books to read immediately' or 'fav horror' or 'recently read books.'   When adding such books you will be able to indicate where you are in terms of reading said book in terms of 'have not started' 'on the third page' 'just finished' or whatever else you like.  One can also delete said lists as they choose as well.
